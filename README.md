# Oscillators

This is a small javascript simulation of coupled oscilators.

I was inspired to create this after watching [Matt Parker's
video](https://youtu.be/J4PO7NbdKXg) on the same phenomenon. The simulation
relies on the Kuramoto model and the design choices have been informed by
[Daniels'
paper](http://go.owu.edu/~physics/StudentResearch/2005/BryanDaniels/kuramoto_paper.pdf)
